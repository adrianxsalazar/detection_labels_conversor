These are several pythons file to transform popular object detection annotation
formats such as COCO Json, VOC xml or Darknet. So the labelling format will not be

The python files in this repo can convert

<ul>
 <li>COCO Json to VOC xml.</li>
 <li>COCO Json to Darknet.</li>
 <li>VOC xml to COCO Sjon.</li>
</ul>

We use COCO Json as a central detection annotation format. We provide tools to

to convert the COCO Json file into any format.

Running the file is simple. You have to use the commands to indicate the location
